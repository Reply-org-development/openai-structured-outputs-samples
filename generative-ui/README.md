To see the arguments for the `generate_ui` tool, you can toggle the JSON view by clicking on the curly braces icon in the top right corner of the UI display.

## Customization

This demo app can be easily customized by modifying the components and their parameters used by the `generate_ui` tool.

Update the `components-definition.ts` file to add or remove components, and make sure you update the `components.tsx` file so that each component definition maps to a React component.
